# quartus-prime
[Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition v21.1](https://www.intel.de/content/www/de/de/products/details/fpga/development-tools/quartus-prime/resource.html) development environment prepackaged into a container.

This container contains the following:
* Intel Quartus Prime Lite Edition v21.1.1
* Questa Intel Starter FPGA Edition-64 Version 2021.2
* All default support Files for:
  * Arria Lite
  * Cyclone IV
  * Cyclone V
  * Cyclone 10 LP
  * Max
  * Max 10

To reduce the size some per default installed parts were removed:
* Intel / Altera IP blocks
* Nios II EDS

## Usage
Generally the container can just be used with:
```shell
docker run ghcr.io/nikleberg/quartus-prime
```
And inside the running container you could for example run tcl scripts for synthesis or simulation like so:
```bash
quartus_sh -t <script>.tcl  # Quartus Shell
vsim -c -do <script>.tcl    # QuestaSim Shell
```

But since v21.1 of Quartus, ModelSim was replaced by QuestaSim. It requires a valid license that can be obtained from [intel](https://licensing.intel.com/). For ease of use a valid license is already included. But it is bound to a specific NIC id e.g. MAC address `00:ab:ab:ab:ab:ab`. Depending on where you want to use the container you have to set the MAC address differently:

### Local
To use the container locally just add a parameter to the docker run command:
```shell
docker run --mac-address=00:ab:ab:ab:ab:ab ghcr.io/nikleberg/quartus-prime
```

### GitHub Action
For using this container as image in the CI environment of GitHub Actions add the docker MAC address option to `jobs.<job_id>.container.options` in the yaml:
```yaml
jobs:
  example:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container:
      image: ghcr.io/nikleberg/quartus-prime:latest
      options: --mac-address=00:ab:ab:ab:ab:ab
    steps:
    - ...
```
See the full example [github-ci-example.yml](github-ci-example.yml).

### GitLab CI
The GitLab CI yaml syntax i.e. its docker runner has [currently](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-runner/-/issues/2344) no capability to set additional docker run options. But if the runner has the `CAP_NET` capability then one can change the MAC address within the container itself. For example with `ifconfig`:
```yaml
example:
  image: ghcr.io/nikleberg/quartus-prime:latest
  before_script: |
    apt-get -q -y update && apt-get -q -y install net-tools
    ifconfig eth0 down
    ifconfig eth0 hw ether "00:ab:ab:ab:ab:ab"
    ifconfig eth0 up
  script: ...
```
See the full example [gitlab-ci-example.yml](gitlab-ci-example.yml).
